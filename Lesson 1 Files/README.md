# ðŸš€ Welcome to Avion School!

Here at Avion School, we teach our students not only how to code but also how to think for themselves. We want to instill the ability to learn independently, even outside class hours. We will guide you, but it's up to you to push yourself and explore. Learning is more exciting that way.

While you have yet to go through any lessons in the Gitbook documentation, check out the files in this lesson. We want you to look through it, figure out how to change a few things, and, most importantly, explore. Share with us later on what you find! Check out the instructions below:

## Project Set Up

- [ ] Open index.html on your left-hand tab.
- [ ] Review the challenge below and make the following edits to introduce yourself:

## Homework

1. Figure out how to change the text "John" to your name.
2. In the section below, tell us what you're doing now and why you want to become a software engineer.
3. Change the picture to yours.
4. Tell us 3 things about you. (i.e what you enjoy doing, your hobbies. Give us a glimpse into your life!)
5. Explore! Share to us later what you found out by playing with the file!
